<!-- 
     This example shows a web page with hardly any html elements,
     but the <span> elements making up the words of the songs
     are created by the javascript.
     
     Thus the javascript is building up the DOM
     
     A similar thing could be done with JQuery instead of
     javascript manipulating raw DOM elements
